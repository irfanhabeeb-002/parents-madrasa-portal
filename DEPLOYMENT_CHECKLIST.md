npm run test -- --run src/tests/accessibility-audit.test.tsx
npm run test -- --run src/tests/icon-consistency.test.tsx

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard
   # Or redeploy previous working commit
   ```

2. **Fix and Redeploy**
   ```bash
   # Fix issues locally
   # Test thoroughly
   # Commit and push fixes
   # Redeploy through Vercel
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor Vercel deployment logs
- Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- Update dependencies regularly
- Run security audits periodically

### Performance Monitoring
- Set up Vercel Analytics
- Monitor bundle size changes
- Track loading performance
- Monitor accessibility compliance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables

### Performance Issues
- Analyze bundle size with `npm run build:analyze`
- Check for unused dependencies
- Optimize images and assets
- Review code splitting configuration

### PWA Issues
- Verify service worker registration
- Check manifest.json validity
- Ensure all icon paths are correct
- Test offline functionality
