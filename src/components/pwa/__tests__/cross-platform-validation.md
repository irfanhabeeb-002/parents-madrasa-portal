## Automated Testing Supplement

While this manual testing is comprehensive, the automated tests in `InstallPrompt.cross-platform.test.tsx` provide additional validation for:

- User agent detection accuracy
- Platform-specific styling application
- PWA detection logic
- Responsive class application
- Performance benchmarks

Run automated tests with:

```bash
npm test -- --run src/components/pwa/__tests__/InstallPrompt.cross-platform.test.tsx
```

## Sign-off Criteria

The cross-platform validation is complete when:

- [ ] All test cases pass on all required platforms
- [ ] No critical or high-severity issues remain
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] User experience is consistent across platforms

## Notes

- Test in incognito/private browsing mode to avoid cached states
- Clear browser data between tests if needed
- Test with different network conditions (3G, WiFi, etc.)
- Consider testing on older device models for performance validation
